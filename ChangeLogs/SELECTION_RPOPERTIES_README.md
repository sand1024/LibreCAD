### Other UI Improvements

Several small improvements for UI are included. 

#### "All Tools" CAD panel (or tools matrix). 

This panel is enabled Application Properties dialog, and if enabled, is replaces all CAD panels by one that includes all tools. 

The main reason for this is better support for CAD panels on small screen resolutions (it simply tookl less screen space). 

Widget Options dialog was also adjusted to support settings for this panel. 

#### Separators in Custom Toolbars and Custom Menus 

Custom Toolbar Creator and Custom Menu Creator now supports adding separators.  

#### Hideable Main menu. 

Top level menu of the application now may be hidden/shown - with appropriate action (default shortcut is **F12**). 

#### Workspace minor improvements
Workspace state now includes the state of main menu and fullscreen.
